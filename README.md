# Active-Time-Counter_Chrome-extension
Displays active time on a website and has a status indicator.

In Impartus virtual classroom, there is no status indicator or timer to display if we are active or not.
this extension makes it easier for us to know if we are active or not(icon turns green if we are active, grey if we aren't).
and as a bonus it has a counter to display active time.
